# Insights — @devdigest/api

Durable findings recorded by the `engineering-insights` skill: things that are
true about this code but not visible in it. Append-only — correct a stale entry
with a dated note beneath it, never edit it away.

**Scope:** only what applies to `@devdigest/api`. Findings that cross package boundaries
go in the repo-root `INSIGHTS.md`.

**Lifecycle:** when an entry hardens into a standing rule, move one line of it
into `CLAUDE.md` as a `NEVER`/`ALWAYS` directive and delete the entry here;
bulky reference material goes to `docs/` instead. This file is the staging
area, not the destination.

Sections are fixed — add to the one that fits, never invent a new heading.
Entry format: `.claude/skills/engineering-insights/reference/entry-format.md`.

## Decisions

### 2026-09-20 — Injection detection is computed live from `body`, never stored

**What:** `Skill.injection_flagged`/`injection_patterns` are NOT columns —
`detectInjectionPatterns(body)` (`modules/_shared/injection-detection.ts`) runs
on every read (`toSkillDto`, `toAgentSkillDetail`) and on every
create/update, where a flagged body forces `enabled: false` server-side
regardless of what the caller asked for (`SkillsService.create`/`update`).

**Why:** the same reasoning as `token_estimate` (also computed live, never
stored): a stored flag can go stale relative to the body it describes — edit
the body to remove the injected text and a stored `true` would linger; edit it
to add some and a stored `false` would miss it. Computing it live makes both
directions self-correcting with no migration, no backfill, and no separate
"re-scan" action. Enforcement piggybacks on the EXISTING
`agent_skills.enabled AND skills.enabled` gate in
`enabledSkillsForPrompt` (`modules/agents/repository.ts`) — forcing
`skills.enabled = false` is sufficient on its own to keep a flagged skill out
of every agent's prompt, so no `agents` module changes were needed for
enforcement, only for the DTO field parity noted below.

**Rejected:** a persisted `injection_flagged` column set once at import time —
would need a migration, a backfill for skills that already exist, and an
explicit re-check action for every future body edit; the live-compute version
needed none of those and cannot drift.

## What Doesn't Work

## Codebase Patterns

- **2026-09-20** — `container.buildLlm`'s "throw `ConfigError` if the secret key
  is missing" guard is a cloud-provider-only rule. For a keyless, local,
  OpenAI-compatible provider (added for Ollama/LM Studio), the right shape is:
  read a base-URL "secret" through the same `SecretsProvider` chokepoint, fall
  back to a hardcoded `localhost` default when unset, and construct the
  adapter unconditionally — no `ConfigError`, no reachability preflight.
  Every caller already catches and degrades (`agents/service.ts listModels` →
  `[]`, `settings/routes.ts test-connection` → `{ ok: false }`), so an
  unreachable local server surfaces naturally on the first real call instead
  of needing a second check. `server/src/platform/container.ts` (`buildLlm`),
  `server/src/adapters/llm/local-openai-compatible.ts`.

- **2026-09-20** — `server/CLAUDE.md`'s "Declare `schema.body`/`schema.params`
  — do not hand-roll `Schema.parse(req.body)`" has an established, deliberate
  exception: a POST route whose body must tolerate being entirely absent (no
  Content-Type, no payload). `reviews/routes.ts`'s `POST /pulls/:id/review`
  does NOT put `body` in the Fastify route schema at all — it parses manually
  inside the handler, `RunRequest.parse(req.body ?? {})`, with a comment
  explaining why ("both fields optional; empty body is OK"). Fastify's own
  body-schema validation rejects a genuinely empty POST body before the
  handler ever runs, which the manual-parse-with-default pattern avoids.
  Reused verbatim for `POST /repos/:id/conventions/extract`'s new optional
  `{ mode }` body (`modules/conventions/routes.ts`). Any new POST route that
  needs to work with zero body should follow this shape, not put an
  `.optional()` object in `schema.body`.

- **2026-09-20** — `skills.evidenceFiles` (jsonb) sat in the DB schema and was
  read by the DTO helper, but was never accepted by `CreateSkillBody`/
  `UpdateSkillBody`, carried by `InsertSkill`/`UpdateSkillPatch`, or written by
  `repository.ts`'s `insert`/`update` — a column that looks wired end-to-end
  because the DTO layer touches it while the write path never did. Found while
  wiring the Conventions feature's skill-drafting flow, which needed
  `evidence_files` to actually persist. Check all three layers
  (routes/service/repository) before assuming a schema column is live, not
  just the schema file. `server/src/modules/skills/{routes,service,repository}.ts`

- **2026-09-20** — `pnpm arch` blocks a module's service/repository from
  importing another module's non-`_shared` file, even for a small, obviously-
  safe read — importing `settings/feature-models.ts`'s
  `getFeatureModelOverride` from `conventions/repository.ts` was flagged. The
  established escape hatch is a repository querying another module's table
  directly (`SkillsRepository` already does this for `agents`/`findings`);
  `ConventionsRepository` does the same for `settings` — it re-reads
  `feature_models` + `FeatureModelChoice.safeParse` itself rather than
  importing the helper. `server/src/modules/conventions/repository.ts`

- **2026-09-20** — Same `no-cross-module-import` rule, other escape hatch: when
  the thing two modules need is a PURE FUNCTION over data both already hold
  (not a query), re-querying isn't an option and duplicating the function is
  worse (it can drift, like the `@devdigest/shared` vendor copies). Move it to
  `modules/_shared/` instead — `skills` (computing `Skill.injection_flagged`)
  and `agents` (`toAgentSkillDetail`, which maps `AgentSkillDetail extends
  Skill`) both needed the identical prompt-injection detector over a skill
  body; it now lives in `modules/_shared/injection-detection.ts` and both
  import it. `_shared` already held two things in this shape (`context.ts`,
  `schemas.ts`) before this — check there before reaching for either the query
  duplication pattern above or a straight cross-module import.

- **2026-09-19** — Two "enabled" flags on the skills feature have OPPOSITE
  version-bump behavior and are easy to conflate. Toggling `skills.enabled`
  (the skill's own global kill-switch) bumps nothing on the skill itself
  (`SkillsRepository`, spec D2/§5.2). Toggling `agent_skills.enabled` (the
  per-agent link flag) via `linkSkill`/`unlinkSkill`/`setSkills` ALWAYS bumps
  the agent's version and snapshots it (spec §7.3) — there is no toggle-only
  exception on the agent side. A change that touches only one of the two
  tables can look identical in a diff but differ in whether it produces a new
  `agent_versions` row. `server/src/modules/agents/repository.ts`

- **2026-09-19** — `AgentsRepository.skillIdsForAgent(agentId)` returns only
  `agent_skills.enabled = true` links, not every linked skill — narrower than
  its name suggests. That's deliberate: it is called ONLY by `snapshotVersion`
  (verified via grep before narrowing it), and `AgentVersionConfig.skills` must
  record "the ids of the links that were enabled when the snapshot was taken"
  (spec §5.3). `linkedSkills(agentId)` is the one that returns every link
  (enabled or not) with its own `enabled` flag — call that one for anything
  that needs to render disabled links (e.g. the Skills tab).
  `server/src/modules/agents/repository.ts`

- **2026-09-19** — `agent_run_skills.order` is the index in the RESOLVED,
  already-filtered list of enabled skills (0, 1, 2…) that
  `enabledSkillsForPrompt` returned — not the original `agent_skills.order`
  column. The two diverge as soon as any link in between is disabled (e.g.
  links at order 0/1/2/3 with #1 disabled record as order 0/1/2 against
  skills #0/#2/#3). Querying "what order was this skill originally linked at"
  needs `agent_skills.order`, not `agent_run_skills.order`.
  `server/src/modules/reviews/run-executor.ts`,
  `server/src/modules/reviews/repository/run.repo.ts`

- **2026-09-18** — `server/CLAUDE.md`'s "Reading `process.env` for a key is
  banned" is true of application code but `platform/config.ts` is not the only
  file that touches the environment, and the other four are all legitimate:
  `adapters/secrets/local.ts:21` takes `process.env` as an injectable
  constructor default (that IS the secrets chokepoint, and tests pass a fake
  env); `adapters/git/simple-git.ts:33-34` WRITES `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT` /
  `GCM_INTERACTIVE` so git subprocesses inherit them; `db/migrate.ts:38` and
  `db/seed.ts:228` read `DATABASE_URL` inside their `import.meta.url ===
  process.argv[1]` CLI blocks. `pnpm lint` enforces the ban with
  `no-restricted-syntax` and names exactly these four as `ignores` in
  `eslint.config.mjs` — a fifth reader is a real violation, not a missing
  exception.

- **2026-09-18** — `server/CLAUDE.md`'s "Layer duties are strict … no raw SQL
  and no HTTP inside a service" describes the intent, not the tree. Eight files
  query the DB outside a repository — `pulls/routes.ts`, `polling/routes.ts`,
  `workspace/routes.ts`, `settings/routes.ts`, `settings/feature-models.ts`,
  `repos/helpers.ts`, `reviews/diff-loader.ts`, `reviews/run-executor.ts` — and
  `pulls`, `polling` and `workspace` have no `service.ts`/`repository.ts` at
  all, so their handlers go straight from URL to SQL. `repos/helpers.ts`
  imports `db/schema.js` under a docblock promising "pure functions only".
  These are allowlisted in `server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`; `pnpm arch` is
  green on the current tree, so any NEW violation is yours. Copying the shape of
  `pulls/routes.ts` for a new endpoint will fail that check.

- **2026-09-17** — `CLAUDE.md`'s "Every table still carries `workspace_id`" is
  not literally true. On the review path only `reviews`, `pull_requests`,
  `agent_runs` and `multi_agent_runs` have the column; `findings`, `pr_intent`,
  `pr_brief`, `pr_files`, `pr_commits` and `run_traces` have none
  (`src/db/schema/reviews.ts:28`, `pulls.ts:35`, `pulls.ts:47`, `runs.ts`).
  They are tenant-scoped only through their parent FK
  (`findings.review_id -> reviews.workspace_id`), so a
  `select().from(t.findings)` with no join to `reviews` reads every workspace
  even though the handler called `getContext()`.

- **2026-09-17** — There is no `score` column on `pull_requests`
  (`src/db/schema/pulls.ts:8-28`, `migrations/0000_init.sql:241-259`). A PR's
  score lives on `reviews.score` (`schema/reviews.ts:23`) and `agent_runs.score`
  (`runs.ts:31`) and has to be joined in. The mistake is invisible to the
  compiler when the query goes through `db.execute(sql.raw(...))`:
  `pnpm typecheck` stays green and Postgres fails at runtime with `42703 column
  does not exist`. The only raw SQL in `src/` is
  `modules/repo-intel/repository.ts:402-406`, and it is parameterised — a new
  raw query needs an `*.it.test.ts` to prove its columns exist.

- **2026-09-17** — A "deliberately not implemented" comment in a route can be
  stale scaffolding, not a decision. `pulls/routes.ts` said the per-severity
  FINDINGS breakdown was "intentionally not surfaced on the list", while
  `rollupSeverities` sat 40 lines away in `pulls/status.ts:23` — exported,
  unit-tested (`test/pulls-status.test.ts:52`), called by nothing, and with a
  module docblock describing that exact breakdown. Before writing a new
  aggregation, grep the module for an unused pure helper: the starter ships
  them ahead of the lesson that wires them up. **2026-09-17, same file:** the
  cost block's comment asserted "latest completed run" as if it were the spec —
  it was the starter's guess, and the user wanted the SUM of every done run.
  Treat a rollup comment in `pulls/routes.ts` as a description of the code, not
  as a product decision: the list's aggregation WINDOW (latest vs all) is never
  written down anywhere, so confirm it before extending a column.

- **2026-09-16** — `completeAgentRun`'s value type is declared TWICE and the two
  copies are not linked: the `ReviewRepository` facade re-types the whole object
  literal (`src/modules/reviews/repository.ts:151`) around the real
  implementation (`src/modules/reviews/repository/run.repo.ts:142`). Adding a
  field to only one of them compiles at the call site and fails at the facade.
  Expect the same shape for other repository methods re-exported through that
  facade.

## Tool & Library Notes

- **2026-09-18** — Two dependency-cruiser settings decide whether `pnpm arch`
  (`server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`) checks anything at all, and both fail
  SILENTLY with a green "no dependency violations found". (1) Listing
  `node_modules` in `options.exclude` drops external modules from the graph, so
  every rule about an npm package (drizzle-orm, fastify, the SDKs) stops
  matching — keep `doNotFollow: { path: 'node_modules' }` for speed and restrict
  `exclude` to `clones`/`dist`. (2) Without
  `options.tsPreCompilationDeps: true`, `import type { … }` crossings are
  invisible, which is most of the boundary traffic in this codebase. Third trap,
  this one loud: on a circular rule `viaNot: 'X'` ("no module in the cycle
  matches X") is NOT the same as the documented-looking `via: { pathNot: 'X' }`
  ("some module does not match X") — the latter is true of nearly every cycle.
  Verify any rule change by injecting a violation and re-running, not by reading
  a green result.

## Recurring Errors & Fixes

- **2026-09-17** — `Run failed: 401 User not found.` mid-agent-run is OpenRouter
  rejecting the key, not a bug in the run pipeline. `container.buildLlm` only
  checks that the secret is a non-empty string
  (`src/platform/container.ts:183`), so `Resolving openrouter provider done
  (0ms)` proves nothing — the first real auth happens in
  `chat.completions.create`. Confirm in one call before reading any code:
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/key`.
  A valid key is `sk-or-v1-` + 64 lowercase hex (73 chars); anything longer or
  mixed-case came from another service. Side effect of a bad key: `PriceBook`
  swallows the 401 (`container.ts:143`) and silently falls back to the static
  price table, so costs still render.

## Session Notes

- **2026-09-20** — Added local LLM provider support (Ollama + LM Studio):
  new `LocalOpenAICompatibleProvider` adapter, `container.buildLlm` branch,
  `Provider`/`ConnTestProvider`/`SecretsStatus` widened in both vendor copies,
  `agents.provider` schema enum widened (no migration needed), Settings API
  Keys panel gained URL-mode rows, client `PROVIDER_OPTIONS` updated in two
  places. See Codebase Patterns and root `INSIGHTS.md` for the reusable parts.

- **2026-09-20** — Added extraction-mode support (`local`/`ai`/`both`) to the
  conventions module: `mode` column + nullable `provider`/`model` on
  `repo_convention_scans` (migration `0014`), `extractLocalCandidates`
  (config-file rule parsing, no model call) in `conventions/helpers.ts`, and
  `POST /repos/:id/conventions/extract` now takes an optional `{ mode }` body.
  Follow-up fix same session: `findConfigFiles` originally probed
  `CONFIG_FILENAMES` only at the clone's true root, so `local` mode found
  nothing on this repo itself — `tsconfig.json`/`eslint.config.*` live inside
  `server/`/`client/`/etc., never at the repo root, since this is a
  multi-package repo with no root `package.json` (root `CLAUDE.md`). Fixed by
  also probing one level into every top-level directory
  (`CONFIG_SEARCH_SKIP_DIRS` in `conventions/constants.ts`). Any future
  root-only file probe in this codebase should ask whether the target repo
  shape (single-package vs. this repo's four-standalone-packages layout)
  actually has what it's looking for at the root.

- **2026-09-19** — Built the full Skills feature (`specs/02-skills.md`): the
  `skills` module (CRUD/versions/import/stats), `agent_skills.enabled`
  per-link flag + `enabledSkillsForPrompt` + agent-version bump on link
  changes, prompt-assembly wiring in `run-executor.ts` + `agent_run_skills`
  recording, migration `0012`, and the client `/skills` rail+editor + the
  Agent editor's Skills tab. Seeded "Test Quality Reviewer" (disabled) + 4
  skills.

- **2026-09-18** — Added `eslint.config.mjs` + a `lint` script, wired `lint`
  and `arch` into `server-unit.yml`, and added migration `0011` (7 FK/filter
  indexes: `findings_review_idx`, `reviews_pr_idx`, `reviews_run_idx`,
  `agent_runs_pr_status_idx`, `agent_runs_status_idx`, `pr_files_pr_idx`,
  `pr_commits_pr_idx`).

- **2026-09-18** — Added the `onion-architecture` skill
  (`.claude/skills/onion-architecture/`) plus `server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
  and a `pnpm arch` script; each rule was confirmed to fire against an injected
  violation before the allowlist was written.

- **2026-09-17** — Ran the PR-review prompt against PR #4 (the
  `test/reviewer-bait` fixture); review only, no code change.

- **2026-09-17** — PR-list COST switched from the latest done run to the sum of
  all done runs (`sumRunCosts` in `modules/pulls/status.ts`); contract comment
  updated in BOTH vendor copies of `contracts/platform.ts`.

- **2026-09-17** — Diagnosed a failing agent run down to an invalid
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; no code change.

- **2026-09-16** — Run Cost: `agent_runs.cost_usd` re-added (migration 0010),
  threaded through the run executor, repository and the PR-list route.
