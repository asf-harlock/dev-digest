# Onion Architecture

Placement and dependency-direction decisions for `@devdigest/api` (`server/`):
which ring a piece of code belongs to, which imports it may make, and how that
is enforced mechanically rather than by hope.

Companion files:
- `examples.md` — ✅/❌ pairs for every rule with a shape worth seeing, taken from real files in this repo.
- `README.md` — the sources this skill is built from, with dates and trust tiers.
- `server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs` — the machine-checkable half. Run it with `cd server && pnpm arch`.

## Scope, and what this deliberately leaves alone

This skill answers **where**. Other skills answer **what** and **how**:

| Question | Skill |
|---|---|
| Where does this backend code live? Which import may it make? | **this one** |
| Same question for React/Next UI | `frontend-ui-architecture` |
| How does this Fastify API behave? | `fastify-best-practices` |
| How do I write this Drizzle query / migration? | `drizzle-orm-patterns` |
| How should this table be shaped and indexed? | `postgresql-table-design` |
| How should this contract be validated? | `zod` |

Scope is `server/` only. `reviewer-core/` already has a stronger invariant of its
own (ZERO I/O, stated in its `CLAUDE.md`) and needs no second set of rules;
`client/` is `frontend-ui-architecture`'s.

## Read this first: say which kind of rule you are invoking

Not every rule below carries the same authority, and presenting a convention as
a hard rule shuts down a decision the team is entitled to make differently. Each
rule is tagged:

- **[Framework]** — Fastify, Drizzle or TypeScript works this way. Violating it breaks something.
- **[Convention]** — Onion / ports-and-adapters as an industry practice. Defensible, not vendor-mandated.
- **[House]** — this repo's own choice, written in `server/CLAUDE.md`. Match it.

Onion Architecture itself is a **convention**: Jeffrey Palermo's 2008 framing of
"all coupling points toward the centre", which Herberto Graça later showed is
the same rule as Ports & Adapters and Clean Architecture with different ring
names. Node gives you no mechanism to enforce it — TypeScript will happily
compile an import from any ring into any other — which is exactly why the
`pnpm arch` half of this skill exists.

## The one principle everything else falls out of

**Dependencies point inward. The inner ring declares the interface; the outer
ring implements it.**

Every rule below is a specialisation of that sentence. When two rules seem to
conflict, this is the tiebreaker. Its value is not tidiness — it is that the
review pipeline's logic can be tested without Postgres, GitHub or an LLM key,
and that swapping an adapter is a container edit rather than a refactor.

The failure mode it prevents is the one that kills most "clean architecture"
attempts: **treating the folder layout as the architecture**. Folders here are
vertical slices (`modules/<name>/`), and `repository.ts` sits inside the slice
while belonging to the infrastructure ring. The ring is decided by the
*filename and its imports*, not by the folder.

## The rings in this codebase

| Ring | What lives there | May import |
|---|---|---|
| **L0 core** | `vendor/shared/**` (Zod contracts + port interfaces), `modules/*/helpers.ts`, `pulls/status.ts`, `reviews/findings.ts`, `platform/grounding.ts`, `platform/prompt.ts`, `@devdigest/reviewer-core` | `zod`, `platform/errors.ts`, `db/rows.ts` (types only), other L0 |
| **L1 ports** | `vendor/shared/adapters.ts` (`LLMProvider`, `GitHubClient`, `GitClient`, `SecretsProvider`, `AuthProvider`, `CodeIndex`, `Embedder`), `repo-intel/types.ts` (`RepoIntel`), `Tokenizer`, `DepGraph` | L0 |
| **L2 services** | `modules/*/service.ts`, `reviews/run-executor.ts`, `reviews/diff-loader.ts`, `repo-intel/pipeline/**` | L0, L1, `type { Container }`, `platform/{errors,jobs,sse}` |
| **L3 infrastructure** | `adapters/**`, `db/**`, `modules/*/repository.ts` | L0, L1, `db`, its own SDK |
| **L4 composition root** | `platform/container.ts`, `app.ts` | everything |
| **L5 entry** | `modules/*/routes.ts`, `modules/index.ts`, `modules/_shared/context.ts` | L0, L2, `container` |

L4 sits outside on purpose: the composition root is the one place allowed to
know every concrete class, because knowing them is its entire job.

## Where a piece of backend code goes

Work down this list and stop at the first match.

1. **It talks to Postgres** → `modules/<name>/repository.ts` (or a file under `repository/`). No exceptions that aren't already in *Known debt*.
2. **It talks to something outside the process** (GitHub, an LLM, git, the filesystem, a tokenizer) → an adapter under `adapters/`, behind an interface in `vendor/shared/adapters.ts`.
3. **It is a pure transform** — row → DTO, rollup, parse, format, score → `helpers.ts` (or the module's named pure file: `status.ts`, `findings.ts`).
4. **It is a literal** — limit, timeout, default, regex, table of model names → `constants.ts`. Every literal, including the ones that look obvious.
5. **It decides or orchestrates** — what happens, in what order, under what conditions → `service.ts`.
6. **It is HTTP** — schema, status code, SSE stream, request/response shape → `routes.ts`.
7. **It is a contract two packages share** → `vendor/shared/contracts/`, in **both** physical copies.

A `routes.ts` should read as: resolve context → validate → call one service
method → return. When a handler starts building a query or branching on
business conditions, steps 1 and 5 were skipped.

## The rules

1. **[Convention] Dependencies point inward, never outward.** L0 never imports L2/L3/L5.
2. **[House] All persistence lives in `repository.ts`.** No `drizzle-orm` import, no `db/schema`, no raw SQL anywhere else. A query in a handler hides tenancy scoping and pins the storage model to a URL.
3. **[House] Fastify types stay in `routes.ts`.** A service that imports `fastify` cannot be called from a job, a script or a test without inventing a request. The only other file allowed to touch it is `modules/_shared/context.ts`.
4. **[House] Take dependencies from the container, never import a concrete adapter.** `container.github()`, not `new OctokitGitHubClient()`. Importing the class defeats `ContainerOverrides`, which is how every test swaps a mock (`src/adapters/mocks.ts`). The one thing a service *does* construct is its own slice's repository, from `container.db` — that is this module's code, and tests swap the database rather than the class.
5. **[Convention] `helpers.ts` / `status.ts` / `findings.ts` are the functional core.** Pure functions over values: no I/O, no `container`, no ORM. They may import row *types* from `db/rows.ts` — a mapper needs the row shape — but never `db/schema` itself. This is the part that unit-tests without Docker.
6. **[House] The Zod contract is the boundary.** A Drizzle row does not leave `repository.ts`; `helpers.ts` maps it to the DTO from `vendor/shared/contracts/`. A route declares `schema.body` / `schema.params` and lets the type provider validate and serialise — never `Schema.parse(req.body)` by hand.
7. **[Convention] Errors are translated at the ring boundary.** A repository raises `AppError` / `NotFoundError` from `platform/errors.ts`; a Postgres error code never travels outward. Callers should not need to know what stores the data.
8. **[House] Tenancy is a domain invariant, not a WHERE clause you remember.** Every handler starts with `getContext(container, req)`. Tables without their own `workspace_id` (`findings`, `pr_*`, `run_traces`) are scoped by joining to the parent that has one — `server/INSIGHTS.md` (2026-09-17) documents the trap.
9. **[House] Secrets come from `container.secrets`; `process.env` is read only in `platform/config.ts`.** After storing a key, call `container.invalidateSecretCaches()` or the cached client keeps the old one.
10. **[Convention] Modules are slices, not a namespace to reach into.** No `modules/a/**` → `modules/b/**` import. Shared entities come from the container (`container.agentsRepo`, `container.reviewRepo`); shared code goes to `modules/_shared/`.

## Ports and the container

A port is an interface written for what the *inside* needs, not a mirror of the
SDK outside. `GitHubClient` in `vendor/shared/adapters.ts` speaks in PRs,
comments and reviews — not in Octokit responses. That is what makes
`MockGitHubClient` a four-line class instead of an HTTP fixture.

The container's shape encodes a distinction worth preserving when you add to it:

- **Sync getters** (`container.git`, `container.codeIndex`, `container.repoIntel`, `container.agentsRepo`) — constructible from config alone.
- **Async methods** (`container.github()`, `container.llm(id)`, `container.embedder()`) — need a secret, so resolving them is I/O and must be awaited.

Wiring a new dependency, in order: interface in `vendor/shared/adapters.ts` →
implementation under `adapters/` → field in `ContainerOverrides` → lazy
getter/method on `Container` → mock in `adapters/mocks.ts`. Skip the override
and the dependency becomes untestable the moment something real sits behind it.

Fastify's own plugin system is a DI mechanism (`decorate` + encapsulation), and
`app.ts` uses exactly one decoration — `app.decorate('container', container)`.
Resist adding a second: two competing injection mechanisms is how a codebase
ends up with services resolved three different ways.

## Persistence: repository, rows, DTOs

Drizzle is a typed query builder, not an entity mapper — there is no ORM layer
that would isolate you by itself, which is precisely why the repository boundary
has to be deliberate. Three consequences:

- Repository methods are named for **domain operations**, not column updates: `completeAgentRun`, `linkSkills`, not `updateColumns`.
- Row types are inferred once in `db/rows.ts` and re-exported by the owning repository. A helper that needs a row shape imports it from `db/rows.ts` directly — importing it *through* another module's repository creates a cycle (see *Known debt*).
- Raw SQL is a special case: `typecheck` cannot see inside `sql.raw(...)`, so a wrong column name reaches production as a runtime `42703`. The only raw query in `src/` is parameterised, in `repo-intel/repository.ts`; a new one needs an `.it.test.ts` proving its columns exist.

The counter-argument is real and worth knowing: with a query builder the
repository pattern can degenerate into a thin, leaky wrapper. The reason it
earns its keep *here* is tenancy and testability, not purity — the workspace
scope and the mock seam both live at that boundary.

## Testing follows the rings

The ring a file sits in decides the kind of test it gets, and the split is
already wired into the filename convention:

| Ring | Test | File |
|---|---|---|
| L0 core, pure helpers | unit, no Docker, no mocks | `test/*.test.ts` |
| L2 services | `buildApp({ overrides })` + `app.inject()` with mocks from `adapters/mocks.ts` | `test/*.test.ts` |
| L3 repositories, raw SQL | testcontainers Postgres | `test/*.it.test.ts` |

If a "unit" test needs Docker, the code under test is in the wrong ring — that
is the cheapest signal this architecture gives you, and it fires before review.

## Enforcement — pick the cheapest tier that fits

A boundary that lives only in documentation decays. Ordered by cost; take the
first tier that expresses what you need and do not stack them.

| Tier | Tool | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Review checklist (below) | A one-off judgement call: does this belong in the service or the helper? |
| 2 | `grep` on the diff | Things the import graph cannot see: `process.env`, `sql.raw`, a row shape escaping a repository. |
| 3 | `pnpm arch` (dependency-cruiser) | Anything expressible as "file X may not import Y". Already configured, already green — keep it that way. |
| 4 | TypeScript project references | You want the compiler, not a linter, to refuse. Fits the four-package split, not folders inside `server/`. |

`server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs` holds eight rules: `core-is-pure`,
`pure-helpers-stay-pure`, `orm-only-in-repository`,
`http-framework-only-in-routes`, `no-concrete-adapter-in-modules`,
`no-vendor-sdk-outside-adapters`, `no-cross-module-import`, `no-circular`.
`cd server && pnpm arch` is a few seconds and exits non-zero on a violation.

Three configuration details it depends on — do not "tidy" them away:

- `tsPreCompilationDeps: true` — otherwise `import type` crossings are invisible, and half these rules check exactly those.
- `node_modules` is **not** excluded — excluding it silently disables every rule about an npm package (drizzle, fastify, the SDKs), and the run still reports success.
- `no-circular` uses `viaNot` on the container: a service importing `type { Container }` while the container constructs that service is the composition root working correctly, not a cycle to break.

What it structurally cannot check, and therefore belongs in the grep pass:
`process.env` outside `config.ts`, a missing `getContext()`, raw SQL column
names, and a Drizzle row escaping a repository through a DTO that was never
mapped.

## Recipe: a new module, ring by ring

1. **Contract** — request/response Zod schemas in `vendor/shared/contracts/<name>.ts`, added to **both** copies of `vendor/shared`.
2. **Port** — only if the feature needs something outside the process: interface in `vendor/shared/adapters.ts`, implementation under `adapters/`, mock in `adapters/mocks.ts`, field in `ContainerOverrides`, accessor on `Container`.
3. **Schema** — table in `db/schema/<name>.ts` (snake_case SQL, camelCase key), re-exported via `db/schema.ts`; row type in `db/rows.ts`; `pnpm db:generate`, never a hand-edited migration.
4. **Repository** — `modules/<name>/repository.ts`, workspace-scoped, domain-named methods, `AppError` on failure.
5. **Helpers + constants** — `helpers.ts` for row → DTO and any pure transform, `constants.ts` for every literal.
6. **Service** — `modules/<name>/service.ts`, constructor takes `Container`, orchestration only.
7. **Routes** — `modules/<name>/routes.ts`: `getContext` → `schema` → one service call.
8. **Register** — one import plus one entry in `modules/index.ts` (registration is static; there is no autoload).
9. **Verify** — `pnpm arch && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`.

## Known debt

These files break the rules today. They sit on an allowlist in
`.dependency-cruiser.cjs` (`ORM_DEBT` and friends) only so that `pnpm arch` stays
green while the debt exists. **The allowlist is not permission to build on it,
and the code already in those files is not a precedent to copy.**

If your task adds or changes behaviour in one of the files below, pay the debt
as the first step, then do the task in the new layers:

1. Move that file's existing DB access into `repository.ts` (create it if the module has none): workspace-scoped, domain-named methods.
2. Put the new decision in `service.ts`, the pure part in `helpers.ts`, the literals in `constants.ts`; leave the route as `getContext` → schema → one service call.
3. Delete the file's entry from the allowlist in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` and its bullet below. The allowlist only ever shrinks; `pnpm arch` must still pass without the entry — that is the proof the debt is gone.

Worked example: "add a 60-second cooldown to `POST /repos/:id/poll`" touches
`polling/routes.ts`. Do not add the check beside the existing `container.db`
calls. Extract them into `polling/repository.ts`, put the cooldown decision in
`polling/service.ts`, then remove `polling/routes` from `ORM_DEBT`.

The one acceptable alternative is to leave the debt in place **and say so
explicitly in your final message** — which file, and why paying it down is out
of scope. Silently adding to the pattern is the one outcome this section exists
to prevent.

- **DB access outside a repository** — `pulls/routes.ts`, `polling/routes.ts`, `workspace/routes.ts`, `settings/routes.ts`, `settings/feature-models.ts`, `repos/helpers.ts`, `reviews/diff-loader.ts`, `reviews/run-executor.ts`. `polling` and `workspace` have no `service.ts`/`repository.ts` at all — a query there goes straight from HTTP to SQL. `pulls` has a `repository.ts` (and a `context-service.ts`), but `pulls/routes.ts` still queries inline: a new `pulls` query belongs in `PullsRepository`, not beside the old ones.
- **`repos/helpers.ts` imports `db/schema`** although its own docblock promises "pure functions only — no I/O, no DB, no container".
- **Cycle `agents/repository.ts` ↔ `agents/helpers.ts`** — the helper takes its row types *through* the repository. One-line fix when next touched: `import type { AgentRow } from '../../db/rows.js'`.
- **`repos/service.ts` imports `repo-intel/constants.ts`** — a cross-module import of constants only.
- **Ports declared inside `adapters/`** — `Tokenizer` and `DepGraph` live next to their implementations instead of in `vendor/shared/adapters.ts`. Importing the *interface* from there is fine and allowlisted; importing the class is not.
- **Pure functions under `adapters/`** — `git/diff-parser.ts`, `codeindex/extract.ts`, `astgrep/index.ts` do no I/O and are core code in an infrastructure folder. Allowlisted; leave them alone unless you are already refactoring that area.

## Where the ecosystem genuinely disagrees

Do not paper over these. Say it is contested, give the trade-off, follow the codebase.

- **Repository pattern over a query builder.** Advocates: a swappable, domain-named seam. Critics: with Drizzle it is often a thin wrapper that buys nothing. Here it buys workspace scoping and the mock seam — that is the argument to make, not purity.
- **How many rings.** Palermo's four, Clean's four, Ports & Adapters' two. They are the same rule with different vocabularies; extra ring names are a cost, not a free upgrade.
- **Rich domain entities vs pure functions over data.** Classic Onion assumes entities with behaviour; this codebase is functional-core/imperative-shell — pure functions in `helpers.ts`, values from contracts. Do not introduce entity classes into a module that has none.
- **Where DTO mapping belongs.** Repository vs a dedicated mapper vs the service. House answer: `helpers.ts`, because it keeps the mapping unit-testable.

## Review checklist

When reviewing backend structure — a PR, or your own work before proposing it:

- Does any `routes.ts` build a query, or branch on business conditions?
- Does every handler start with `getContext()`, and does every query reach `workspace_id` — directly or through a join?
- Is there a `new SomeAdapter()` where `container.<thing>` would do?
- Does a service or repository import `fastify`?
- Did a Drizzle row escape `repository.ts` without being mapped to a contract DTO?
- Is a literal sitting inline instead of in `constants.ts`?
- Does a new `helpers.ts` function do I/O, or take the container?
- Does a new port have a mock and a `ContainerOverrides` field?
- Was a contract changed in only one copy of `vendor/shared`?
- Does `pnpm arch` still pass, and did the allowlist grow?

## In DevDigest specifically

- **Modules register statically** in `src/modules/index.ts` — a new module is a file plus one import and one entry. There is no autoload.
- **Layer filenames are fixed**: `routes.ts`, `service.ts`, `repository.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `constants.ts`. Anything else is a kebab-case module (`diff-loader.ts`, `run-executor.ts`), and a folder (`reviews/repository/`) when one file stops being enough.
- **`@devdigest/shared` exists in two physical copies** (`server/src/vendor/shared/`, `client/src/vendor/shared/`) that have already drifted. Change a contract → change both in the same commit. `reviewer-core` reads the server copy.
- **`vendor/**` is vendored** — read it, do not edit it except when changing a contract.
- **`_` means private to its parent** (`modules/_shared/`, `db/schema/_shared.ts`). Never import one from outside.
- **Migrations never run on boot**; `relation ... does not exist` means `pnpm db:migrate`, not a schema bug.
- **`POST /pulls/:id/review` is fire-and-forget** by design, and `repo-intel` degrades rather than throwing. Both are deliberate shapes of the service ring — do not "fix" them into synchronous or throwing code.
- The repo is **not a pnpm workspace**; packages are linked only by tsconfig path aliases, which is why `pnpm arch` is configured per package and reads `server/tsconfig.json` to resolve `@devdigest/shared`.

## Version history

- **1.0.0** (2026-09-18) — First version. Rings, rules and the debt inventory derived from a read of `server/src` at commit `e885435`; `pnpm arch` verified green on that tree, with each rule confirmed to fire against a deliberately injected violation. Sources in `README.md`.
- **1.1.0** (2026-10-08) — *Known debt* rewritten as an instruction instead of a description. Eval basis: on Haiku (effort low) 0 of 3 skill-arm runs paid down `polling/routes.ts` and none removed its allowlist entry; they read the allowlist as permission. The section now says to pay the debt first, shows the `polling` cooldown as a worked example, allows only an explicit "left in place, because…" exception, and corrects the `pulls` inventory entry (it has had a `repository.ts` since the inventory was written). Not yet re-run — see `.claude/evals/onion-architecture/README.md`.
